# US Flight Delays and Cancelations Dataset

The dataset files (`airlines.csv`, `airports.csv`, and `flights.csv`) are too large to include directly in this repository to avoid Git and GitHub storage issues.

To access the full dataset, please visit the original Kaggle source:

You can download all files there and place them in this directory if you'd like to run this project locally.
